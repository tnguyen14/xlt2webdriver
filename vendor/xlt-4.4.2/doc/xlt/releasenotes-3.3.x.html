 <div id="content"><h2 id="XLT3.3.5">XLT 3.3.5</h2><p class="abstract">This section lists and documents all important fixes in Xceptance LoadTest 3.3.5. Registered customers can access an overview of changes and the latest roadmap at the <a href="https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/29">XLT Information Center</a>.</p><h3 id="FeaturesandImprovements">Features and Improvements</h3><h4 id="AddwaitForElementmethod597">Add waitForElement() method (#597)</h4><p>It is quite common in today&#8217;s web applications that a page is not just loaded by a single request, but the page is assembled from the responses of multiple (AJAX) requests. Furthermore, the page might be constantly updated by JavaScript jobs, scheduled via <code>window.setTimeout()</code> and <code>window.setInterval()</code>. From the framework&#8217;s perspective it is hard to tell whether a page is loaded completely now, or at least &#8220;complete enough&#8221; to continue with the test case. A better way is to leave that decision to the test case designer, who has to specify when to go on with the test case. Formerly, the framework could only be instructed to wait until all JS jobs are finished or a certain timeout period had exceeded, but this was not flexible enough and could lead to longer waiting times, and hence, longer test case execution times. Now the test case designer can also instruct the framework to wait for a certain HTML element to appear on the page before going on, no matter whether there are still JS background jobs running or pending. </p><p>The solution is twofold. First, we need a method which waits until that special element (addressed by an XPath expression) appears on the page:</p><pre class="java"><code>public static List&lt;HtmlElement&gt; waitForHtmlElements(HtmlPage page, String xpath, long timeout);

</code></pre><p>As its result, the method returns all elements that were located by the specified XPath. In order to not wait forever in case of an error, a maximum waiting time has to be given, after which an exception will be thrown. This method is now part of <code>HtmlPageUtils</code>.</p><p>Second, we have to deal with the fact that the existing <code>loadPageXYZ()</code> methods <em>cancel</em> any already scheduled, but not yet running JS job before returning. This means that the above method alone was not enough, as the JS code that creates the element might not get executed at all. Formerly, one could only control, for <em>how long</em> the <code>loadPageXYZ()</code> methods will wait for the completion of JS jobs (also including periodic jobs) before canceling these jobs, but not whether these jobs should be canceled at all. In order to support this new behavior, the allowed value range of the timeout parameter was extended:</p><ul><li><code>loadPageByClick(button)</code> [already available] -&gt; waits at most XX s (XX as configured in <code>default.properties</code>) for running JS jobs to finish and after that time cancels any <em>pending</em> jobs</li><li><code>loadPageByClick(button, 0)</code> [already available] -&gt; as above, but with XX := 0 s</li><li><code>loadPageByClick(button, 10000)</code> [already available] -&gt; as above, but with XX := 10 s</li><li><code>loadPageByClick(button, -1)</code> <strong>[new]</strong> -&gt; returns immediately <em>without</em> waiting for jobs to finish or canceling pending jobs</li></ul><p>In combination, a typical code snippet might look like this:</p><pre class="java"><code>protected void execute() throws Exception
{
    // get and click the button
    HtmlPage previousPage = getPreviousAction().getHtmlPage();
    HtmlElement button = HtmlPageUtils.findHtmlElements(previousPage, "id('foo')");
    loadPageByClick(button, -1);
    
    // wait 20 secs for the result to appear on the page
    HtmlPage currentPage = getHtmlPage();
    HtmlPageUtils.waitForHtmlElements(currentPage, "id('bar')/div", 20000);
}

</code></pre><h4 id="NewmethodAbstractHtmlPageAction.setHtmlPageintroduced1005">New method AbstractHtmlPageAction.setHtmlPage() introduced (#1005)</h4><p>Formerly, the resulting page of an action was only implicitly set &#8211; by one of the <code>loadPage...()</code> methods. However, there are situations when one would like to set a different page, for example if an action implicitly opens a pop-up page, but not the pop-up page, but the main page should be the result of the action. Now there is a new method <code>AbstractHtmlPageAction#setHtmlPage()</code>, which can be used to override the resulting page of an action.</p><h3 id="BugFixes">Bug Fixes</h3><h4 id="WrongpagereturnedfromHtmlSelectsetSelectedAttribute912">Wrong page returned from HtmlSelect#setSelectedAttribute() (#912)</h4><p>When selecting an option from a select box on a certain page (via <code>HtmlSelect#setSelectedAttribute()</code>), the resulting page was <em>always</em> the original page, which is wrong in case some JavaScript code changed the document location, opened a pop-up window, etc. Fixed now.</p><h4 id="NumberFormatExceptionduringreportcreation977">NumberFormatException during report creation (#977)</h4><p>When logging events, the name of the test case which produced the event has to be provided. As the test case name the current virtual user&#8217;s name is expected (as returned from <code>Session.getCurrent().getUserName()</code>). It is important that exactly this name is specified as otherwise the event cannot be associated with a test case in the test report. If a different name is specified, for example the test case&#8217;s fully-qualified class name, we will get a new transaction with that name in the report, for which events but no run time values exist. This caused a NumberFormatException during report generation. Fixed now.</p><p>In order to avoid giving an event a wrong test case name, the method <code>DataManager#logEvent(String eventName, String testCaseName, String message)</code> has been deprecated in favor of the new method <code>DataManager#logEvent(String eventName, String message)</code>, which implicitly sets the correct test case name.</p><h4 id="WrongperXvaluesintestreportwhenusingsequentialmode1004">Wrong per-X values in test report when using sequential mode (#1004)</h4><p>A load test can be run in sequential mode (<code>mastercontroller ... -sequential</code>). In this mode, all configured test cases are not run in parallel, but sequentially. A separate results directory will be created for each test case. If the master controller was configured to automatically create a load test report from the results (<code>mastercontroller ... -sequential -report</code>), all per-X values were wrong for all reports except the first. </p><p>The reason for this misbehavior was that the start time of the respective test was not newly determined when calculating the test report for each test case, but the start time of the first test was taken for all reports. This way, the test duration got longer with each test case, messing up all values that rely on the duration.</p><p>Note that this issue did not occur if the test reports were created afterwards, separately for each test case. This is also the way to go to correct wrong reports: simply recreate them.     </p><h4 id="TimetoFirstLastisextremelylargeincaseofsockettimeouts1073">Time to First/Last is extremely large in case of socket timeouts (#1073)</h4><p>In the test report, we can see the network timing statistics for each type of request. However, the minimum and maximum values for <em>Time-to-first-bytes</em> and <em>Time-to-last-bytes</em> were sometimes implausible (either negative or extremely large), especially in case of socket read time-outs. Fixed now.</p><h4 id="Trendreportreferstowrongchartsdirectoryforcustomtimers1127">Trend report refers to wrong charts directory for custom timers (#1127)</h4><p>The charts directory of trend reports was incorrect for custom timers. Charts were generated to the &#8216;customTimers&#8217; directory, but they should go to the &#8216;custom&#8217; directory. Fixed now.</p><h2 id="XLT3.3.4">XLT 3.3.4</h2><p class="abstract">This section lists and documents all important fixes in Xceptance LoadTest 3.3.4. Registered customers can access an overview of changes and the latest roadmap at the <a href="https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/28">XLT Information Center</a>.</p><h3 id="BugFixes2">Bug Fixes</h3><h4 id="StackOverflowErrorwhenhandlingonblurevents940">StackOverflowError when handling onblur events (#940)</h4><p>Under certain circumstances, the <code>onblur</code> handler of an HTML element might be called recursively, causing a <code>StackOverflowError</code>. Fixed now.     </p><h2 id="XLT3.3.3">XLT 3.3.3</h2><p class="abstract">This section lists and documents all new features, improvements, and important fixes in Xceptance LoadTest 3.3.3. Registered customers can access an overview of changes and the latest roadmap at the <a href="https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/26">XLT Information Center</a>.</p><h3 id="Features">Features</h3><h4 id="SimplefrontendapplicationtomanageAWSEC2instances695">Simple front-end application to manage AWS EC2 instances (#695)</h4><p>The Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud service is a perfect fit for on-demand load testing. XLT agents can easily be run from EC2 instances. Up to now, configuring the master controller to use the new agents was a tedious job, especially if many agent machines were involved, as it includes to manually get the current IP address of each machine and create a corresponding line in the mastercontroller&#8217;s configuration. Now there is a command-line tool that simplifies the handling of Amazon EC2 instances in general. It provides the following functionality:</p><ul><li>start new instances (with only a few options)</li><li>stop running instances</li><li>list running instances (and print a corresponding agent controller configuration ready to be pasted into <code>mastercontroller.properties</code>)</li></ul><p>Note that this tool is not intended to replace the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS console</a> or similar tools.</p><p>Before you can use the tool, you have to configure it appropriately. There is a new configuration file: <code>&lt;xlt&gt;/config/ec2_admin.properties</code>. The most important settings are your AWS credentials. These are needed to authorize any AWS operation, which is executed on your behalf.    </p><pre class="plain"><code>## Your AWS credentials. 
aws.accessKey = &lt;enter your access key&gt;
aws.secretKey = &lt;enter your secret key&gt;

## The protocol to use (defaults to https).
#aws.protocol = https

## HTTP proxy settings. 
#aws.proxy.host = localhost
#aws.proxy.port = 8888
#aws.proxy.userName = 
#aws.proxy.password = 

</code></pre><p>You may also configure a proxy if one is required to be used in your environment. </p><p>To run the tool, call one of the two scripts <code>&lt;xlt&gt;/bin/ec2_admin.sh</code> or <code>&lt;xlt&gt;\bin\ec2_admin.cmd</code> depending on your OS choice. The tool will guide you through the available operations via a menu-based UI. Keep in mind, that you can easily run XLT in a heterogeneous environment and control Linux based agents from a Microsoft Windows environment.</p><blockquote class="note"><p>Note that when creating AWS instances from AMIs you will see your own AMIs to choose from, but you may also see public AMIs provided by Xceptance. These AMIs are pre-packaged systems, which are optimized for load testing and have XLT already installed. Using one of these AMIs may save you the work to create and maintain your own AMIs, but may also impose additional costs. See the AMI&#8217;s description for more details.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="warning"><p>When using the new EC2 management UI for XLT, please be aware of the fact, that XLT does not distinguish between instances it started and instance you have started manually when using the stop command. For fine-grained control, we recommend the <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/">AWS Management Console</a>.</p></blockquote><h3 id="Improvements">Improvements</h3><h4 id="Extensivenetworkstatistics448">Extensive network statistics (#448)</h4><p>Now the load test report features extensive network statistics on the <em>Requests</em> page displaying data for bandwidth utilization and socket timing information.</p><p class="illustration"><a href="images/releasenotes/xlt333/network-statistics-large.png"><img border="0" src="images/releasenotes/xlt333/network-statistics-small.jpg"/></a> <span class="caption">The new network statistics section</span></p><p>The bandwidth tab displays information about the use incoming and outgoing bandwidth per request. XLT measures on socket level and therefore the real transfered data out and in of the application is measured. XLT does not analyze or modify that data when taking the measurements. Bytes Sent comprises all data that is sent out of the application including overhead such as http(s) headers and SSL protocol data. Bytes Received includes all received data and the connected overhead. There is no measurement difference between sent and received data. </p><p>Network Timing reports all low level network timing data that have been measured on socket level. Each measurement point contains information about minimum and maximum times occurred as well as the mean of all gathered data.</p><ul><li>Connect Time: Time needed to establish a connection to the other system. Please note when using keep-alive semantics during testing, the connect time will mainly be 0 except for the first request of a transaction.</li><li>Send Time: Time required to send the request to the other system. Depending on the payload and the network speed, this data is often zero or very small.</li><li>Server Busy Time: This indicated the time waiting after sending the last bytes till the first bytes are received.</li><li>Receive Time: The time spent receiving data. Measured from the first bytes received till the last bytes received.</li><li>Time to First Bytes: Total time from the connection start till the first bytes are received. Includes Connect, Send, Server Busy, and Receive Time.</li><li>Time to Last Bytes: Total time from the connection start till the last bytes are received. This is the time needed to connect, send, and receive data. Often this time is called network runtime. The request runtime in comparison contains the network runtime and the application time needed to process header and protocol information and transfer the data from socket level to the application level. </li></ul><h4 id="Consistenthostnames589">Consistent host names (#589)</h4><p>A load agent uses its host name/IP address to qualify the name under which resource usage values are stored. The agent used to determine its local IP address itself. However, the result is not necessarily the same address as the one configured at the master controller, in case:</p><ul><li>the machine has more than one address, or</li><li>the machine&#8217;s externally visible address is different than the internal one (NAT).</li></ul><p>This can be confusing. Now the master controller passes the host name to the agent, and the agents always use that name/address when writing resource usage data. So all host names in the test report should be consistent with the master controller&#8217;s configuration now.  </p><h4 id="APItoaccessagentinformation669">API to access agent information (#669)</h4><p>Sometimes it is required to let an agent know what its name is and how many other agents take part in a load test. This information is especially useful when managing agent-specific resources, such as test data, which is exclusive to a certain agent. Now the <code>Session</code> class provides additional methods to access agent information:</p><ul><li><code>Session.getAgentID()</code> - the name of the current agent, as configured in <code>config/mastercontroller.properties</code></li><li><code>Session.getTotalAgentCount()</code> - the total count of agents participating in the load test</li><li><code>Session.getAgentNumber()</code> - the number (or index) of the current agent (ranges from 0 to total agent count &#8211; 1)</li></ul><p>You can use these values to access different test data files for and from your test cases or to partition a test data set into agent-specific chunks.   </p><h4 id="Relaxedcookieimplementationtobecompatiblewithbrowsers701">Relaxed cookie implementation to be compatible with browsers (#701)</h4><p>Internet browsers, such as Internet Explorer or Firefox, accept cookies even if the path attribute specified in the cookie does not match the request. XLT rejects such cookies by default (as mandated by the HTTP specification), however, it can be re-configured now to behave exactly like the real browsers if needed. Now there is a new property <code>com.xceptance.xlt.http.acceptCookiesWithInvalidPath</code> in file <code>default.properties</code>, which controls whether cookies with invalid paths are accepted (true) or rejected (false). The property value defaults to false. </p><h4 id="CredentialsforHTTPauthenticationconfigurable757">Credentials for HTTP authentication configurable (#757)</h4><p>If the target server requires HTTP user authentication, the necessary credentials could only be set programmatically. Similar to the proxy authentication, you can use these new properties from the file <code>config/default.properties</code> now:</p><pre class="plain"><code>com.xceptance.xlt.auth.userName = &lt;your_name&gt;
com.xceptance.xlt.auth.password = &lt;your_password&gt;
#com.xceptance.xlt.auth.domain = &lt;your_domain&gt;

</code></pre><p>The <code>domain</code> setting is necessary for the NTLM authentication scheme only.</p><p>Note that these settings are <em>global</em> settings and will be used for <em>all</em> servers that require authentication. If you need different credentials for different servers, you still have to set them programmatically.</p><h2 id="XLT3.3.2">XLT 3.3.2</h2><p class="abstract">This section lists and documents all new features, improvements, and important fixes in Xceptance LoadTest 3.3.2. Registered customers can access an overview of changes and the latest roadmap at the <a href="https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/24">XLT Information Center</a>.</p><h3 id="Improvements2">Improvements</h3><h4 id="ScriptRecordercompatiblewithFirefox3.6657">Script Recorder compatible with Firefox 3.6 (#657)</h4><p>Now the XLT script recorder is also compatible with Firefox 3.6.x.</p><h4 id="AlternativeloadPagemethodforlightweightmode666">Alternative loadPage() method for light-weight mode (#666)</h4><p>The class <code>AbstractHtmlPageAction</code> already supports a variant of the <code>loadPage(URL)</code> method, which gives finer control how a request is actually executed: </p><pre class="plain"><code>protected void loadPage(final URL url, final List&lt;NameValuePair&gt; requestParameters, final HttpMethod method)
</code></pre><p>Via this method, the test case designer can choose the HTTP method to be used and pass additional request/form parameters. Now the same functionality is available for <code>AbstractLightWeightPageAction</code> as well.</p><h2 id="XLT3.3.1">XLT 3.3.1</h2><h3 id="Features2">Features</h3><p class="abstract">This section lists and documents all new features and additions to Xceptance LoadTest 3.3.1. Registered customers can access an overview of changes and the latest roadmap at the <a href="https://lab.xceptance.de/versions/23">XLT Information Center</a>.</p><h4 id="Commentingtestsandtestexecutions105">Commenting tests and test executions (#105)</h4><p>Testing is documenting, therefore XLT delivers a new feature that permits to add custom comments to the project and to the test execution. This improves the documentation quality and helps to make load testing more efficient.</p><p class="illustration"><img border="0" src="images/releasenotes/xlt331/xlt-comments.png"/> <span class="caption">Some example text demonstrating the comment  feature</span></p><p>Project comments are comments that have been added to the property files by using the new property <code>com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.comment</code>. Comments can stretch across multiple lines in the property files, when the line break is escaped with a backslash (\). This line break will not cause a line break in the test report.   </p><pre class="plain"><code>com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.comment = This configuration tests the reaction on heavily changing thinktimes. \
Therefore the user count is extremely high to accommodate that.

</code></pre><p>Besides  the comment property, a comment can be entered during test execution. On the command line, the master controller supports the new option <code>-comment</code>. The command line comment will be added to the test property file automatically to be available for a later report creation or re-creation. When running the master controller in interactive mode, you will be asked whether or not you want to add a comment to the last test execution.</p><pre class="plain"><code>./mastercontroller.sh -auto -comment "Using two additional web servers for this test."

</code></pre><p>The comment feature supports HTML  to give you the ability to express test comments in a more structured way.</p><pre class="plain"><code>com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.comment = This configuration tests the reaction on heavily changing &lt;em&gt;thinktimes&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;br/&gt; \
Therefore the user count is &lt;span style="color: Red;"&gt;extremely&lt;/span&gt; high to accommodate that.

</code></pre><blockquote class="warning"><p>All  comments will be placed without sanitation into the report. Therefore broken HTML code can break the report. If this happens, the comment HTML can be fixed by editing the property files and re-creating the report. The command line comment was automatically appended to the test property file used, so any mistake made can also be easily fixed later on.</p></blockquote><p>If you would like to apply several different comments, such as a comment in the project property file and one or more additional comments in your test property file, you can add numbers to the comments. The comments will be included in their natural order. This means <code>com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.comment</code> comes first, after that all numbered comments, such as <code>...comment.1</code> or <code>...comment.8</code>. The comment from the command line will be placed at the end. </p><pre class="plain"><code>com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.comment.1 = This is a comment.
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.comment.2 = This is another comment.
com.xceptance.xlt.loadtests.comment.9 = Here comes another one, completely out of order, but valid.

</code></pre><h3 id="Improvements3">Improvements</h3><h4 id="Supportaweightfactorforloadmachines634">Support a weight factor for load machines (#634)</h4><p>By default, the configured load is distributed equally across all agent machines. If some of the agent machines are slower than the others, the load tester has to manually assign the number of users to agent machines to achieve an equal load level on each machine. When the total number of users changes often, this approach is uncomfortable and error-prone. Now a &#8220;weight&#8221; factor can be defined once for each participating agent machine and that weight is taken into consideration when automatically distributing the load across machines.</p><p>Now the master controller&#8217;s configuration looks like this:</p><pre class="plain"><code>com.xceptance.xlt.mastercontroller.agentcontrollers.ac1.url = https://agentmachine1:8500
com.xceptance.xlt.mastercontroller.agentcontrollers.ac1.weight = 5
com.xceptance.xlt.mastercontroller.agentcontrollers.ac2.url = https://agentmachine2:8500
com.xceptance.xlt.mastercontroller.agentcontrollers.ac2.weight = 20
</code></pre><p>In this case, <code>agentmachine2</code> gets four times the load of <code>agentmachine1</code>.</p><h4 id="ImprovedandstreamlinedWebDriversupport626">Improved and streamlined WebDriver support (#626)</h4><p>WebDriver is finally merging with Selenium. Therefore we decided to further improve the WebDriver support. Now XLT does not only support the main API and its principles, it is also compatible with the <code>HtmlUnitDriver</code>. Therefore it can be used as a drop-in replacement.  Additionally the streamlined API guarantees compatibility with browser drivers, such as the <code>FirefoxDriver</code> or the <code>ChromeDriver</code>.</p><blockquote class="warning"><p>The principles how to use the WebDriver and how to inject the needed data to have a corresponding action concept in place have changed.</p></blockquote><p>The XltDriver has to be created like a normal driver now: <code>new XltDriver()</code>. The previously available method <code>setActionName(String)</code> was dropped because it made it impossible to replace the XltDriver with any other driver. Please use this XLT-API method <code>Session.getCurrent().setWebDriverActionName(String)</code> instead. This method will only have an effect for <code>XltDriver</code>-based test cases. For all other drivers as well as the action-based test cases, it will not be active. Any set data will be ignored.   </p><h5 id="PreviousXLTWebDriversupport">Previous XLT WebDriver support</h5><pre class="java"><code>// get web driver
final XltDriver driver = getDriver();

// turn off Javascript because we want to run a resource-friendly load test
driver.getWebClient().setJavaScriptEnabled(false);

</code></pre><blockquote class="information"><p>Make sure you take a look at the provided test cases in the <code>sample/testsuite-pebble</code> directory. They show how to interact with the XltDriver. Basically now it is no difference anymore whether you work with the drivers provided by the WebDriver project or the XltDriver.</p></blockquote><p>More material about WebDriver and especially documentation how to work with WebDriver, can be found in the official documentation under <a href="http://seleniumhq.org/docs/09_webdriver.html">Selenium 2.0 and WebDriver</a>.</p><h4 id="PoolThreadsRenamed619">Pool Threads Renamed (#619)</h4><p>XLT maintains a pool of threads, which are responsible for downloading static content in parallel.  The naming of these threads was rather generic, as can be seen here: </p><pre class="plain"><code>[2009/11/15-00:17:36,904] ERROR [pool-8289-thread-2] runtime - Failed to load static content from: http://www.mysystem.de/images/sky.gif

This happens only if an action does not load a new page, but only modifies the current page (via JavaScript). As a consequence, the page associated with the previous action is modified too. This is a side effect of the HTML page dumping mechanism, which tries to store an internal copy of the page as late as possible to improve performance. </p><p>Not having the exact page for a certain action might be a problem during test case development, but note that in this case the output mode is usually set to <code>always</code>, which does not show this behavior as a separate page is always dumped after each action.   </p><p>While load testing, however, the output mode is typically set to <code>onError</code>. In this case, the load tester must decide when the framework should dump pages to disk. Therefore, there is a new property <code>com.xceptance.xlt.output2disk.onError.dumpMode</code>, which controls whether a page is to be saved after each action (value <code>modifiedAndFinalPages</code>) or only before loading a completely new page (value <code>finalPagesOnly</code>). By default, the property value is <code>finalPagesOnly</code>.

Because comparing reports manually is tiresome and error-prone, XLT delivers a new and sophisticated report type &#8211; the comparison report.</p><p class="illustration"><a href="images/releasenotes/xlt33/comparison-report-actions-large.png"><img border="0" src="images/releasenotes/xlt33/comparison-report-actions-small.jpg"/></a> <span class="caption">An example for comparing action performance</span></p><p>The XLT comparison report feature helps you identify differences between test runs and derive the right actions from it. It visualizes differences on all measurement levels (transactions, actions, requests, and custom timers). A color code helps you to find the biggest difference quickly. Therefore you can easily combine it with the setup of your test and derive the next actions from it.</p><p>For instance, you increased the memory limits of your server&#8217;s Java virtual machine and you ran the same test again. By comparing the results before and after the server configuration change, you can easily determine how much improvement you got. Of course, the results might have an error margin of 5-10%, in this case, you should question your test and asked yourself, if you measure the right things over the right time period.</p><h5 id="Howtocreateit">How to create it</h5><p>Comparison reports are created similar to normal load test reports. The command line tool <code>create_diff_report.sh</code> located in <code>&lt;xlt&gt;/bin</code> starts the creation process. You simply pass the two reports you want to compare. The first report is the baseline, the second one will be compared to that baseline.</p><p>You  can specify an alternate output directory with the <code>-o</code> option. By default, the new report is placed in the <code>reports</code> directory of your current XLT installation.</p><pre class="plain"><code>create_diff_report.sh &lt;baseline_report_dir&gt; &lt;second_report_dir&gt; [-o &lt;alternative_output_dir&gt;]
</code></pre><blockquote class="information"><p>On Windows, the respective program is called <code>create_diff_report.cmd</code>.</p></blockquote><h5 id="Howtointerpretit">How to interpret it</h5><p>Interpreting a comparison report is simple, because its colors indicate the performance development and make it easy to see any development. Green cells indicate an improvement, red cells a performance degradation. The intensity of the color corresponds to the percentage value of the difference. The more the darker. Color values in the range of -10% to +10% are close to neutral white, because changes in that range are often measurement errors or normal fluctuations. </p><p>All data is relative and differences are reported in percentages. Hover the cursor over cells to see the measurement values of both reports. These details allow you evaluate the performance difference further by seeing the real values and hence the real difference. This means, a 100% difference can be OK, when the measurement values are small enough in the first place, such as 10 msec for instance. The second measurement reported 20 msec and therefore the performance dropped significantly in percent but not in milliseconds. A difference of 10 msec can be caused by a small network latency  and might be normal white noise during testing.</p><blockquote class="warning"><p>The comparison report requires load test reports generated with XLT 3.3 or higher, because the underlying result data schema has changed. To compare older data, you can rerun the report creation with XLT 3.3, if you saved the result data directories.</p></blockquote><h4 id="TrendReports472">Trend Reports (#472)</h4><p>Comparison reports are good to see the performance difference between two test runs in the greatest detail possible. However, quite often a <em>series</em> of test runs has to be compared to see how the application under test has changed over time in terms of performance. This is especially important for applications which are under active development. For this, XLT provides <em>trend</em> reports. </p><h5 id="Howtocreateit2">How to create it</h5><p>As you might have already guessed, creating a trend report is as easy as creating comparison or normal load test reports. Just run the command line tool <code>create_trend_report.sh</code> located in <code>&lt;xlt&gt;/bin</code>. As arguments you simply pass the load test report directories, which you want to be included in the trend report. Instead of naming the directories one by one, you may also use the shell&#8217;s wild card characters to specify a bunch of reports at once. The trend report will be generated to XLT&#8217;s <code>reports</code> directory by default. You can specify an alternate output directory with the <code>-o</code> option.</p><pre class="plain"><code>create_trend_report.sh &lt;report_dir_1&gt; &lt;report_dir_2&gt; ... &lt;report_dir_N&gt; [-o &lt;alternative_output_dir&gt;]
</code></pre><blockquote class="information"><p>On Windows, the respective program is called <code>create_trend_report.cmd</code>.</p></blockquote><h5 id="Howtointerpretit2">How to interpret it</h5><p>For trend reports, it is typically sufficient to have only the most important performance numbers at hand &#8211; the run time statistics. These values are primarily shown as graphs, which makes it easy to recognize the application behavior over time. </p><p class="illustration"><a href="images/releasenotes/xlt33/trend-report-chart-large.png"><img border="0" src="images/releasenotes/xlt33/trend-report-chart-small.png"/></a> <span class="caption">A trend chart</span></p><p>Additionally, the run time difference values (in percent) are displayed in two tables with color-coded cells, as seeen in the comparison reports.

Green cells indicate an improvement.</p><p class="illustration"><a href="images/releasenotes/xlt33/trend-report-requests-large.png"><img border="0" src="images/releasenotes/xlt33/trend-report-requests-small.png"/></a> <span class="caption">The run time differences relative to the first test run</span></p><p>The second table visualizes the difference between the current test run and the <em>previous test run</em>, again using color-coded cells.

WebDriver supports HtmlUnit as one possible browser. XLT integrates the WebDriver API now and enables you to leverage existing WebDriver automation skills. The integration gives XLT a second API, besides the Action Concept API. Additionally XLT gives you the ability to write WebDriver test cases and run them as load tests. </p><blockquote class="information"><p>More information about Google WebDriver can be found on the home page of the project: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/webdriver/">Google WebDriver</a> and in an article on the Google Open Source Blog: <a href="http://google-opensource.blogspot.com/2009/05/introducing-webdriver.html">Introducing WebDriver</a>   </p></blockquote><p>The usage of WebDriver with XLT is demonstrated in sample test cases which can be found in the test suite (<code>&lt;xlt&gt;/samples/testsuite</code>). All test cases are one-to-one adaptations of the standard  XLT demonstration test cases, which utilize  the action concept.</p><h5 id="WebDrivervs.Actions">WebDriver vs. Actions</h5><p>The action concept separates, encapsulates and isolates a step in the page flow. Its API is designed to guide you to achieve perfect test validation and optimal reuse. Although this results in various classes (one class per action), the effective test code is short, easy to read, and to maintain. Additionally you have full access to the powerful HtmlUnit API, that offers you control over nearly every aspect of the simulated web browser.</p><p>In contrast, the WebDriver concept only offers an API to access basic elements and does not guide you on how to write a test. But because of its low complexity, it is perfectly suited to write test very quickly. This is important for rapid prototyping and software projects which have not reached enough HTML/CSS/JavaScript stability to justify the investment in reuse and full test coverage.  The WebDriver API looks familiar to users of Selenium, Watir, and other comparable projects. Therefore the switch from one of these products to XLT is easy. Due to the fact that the WebDriver concept is based on the reduction to basic user operations, the API is not as powerful as HtmlUnit&#8217;s API but easier to learn and to use.</p><p><a href="http://code.google.com/p/webdriver">WebDriver</a> intends to act as an <em>idealized web browser</em>, so its API offers methods to perform actions that web browser users normally do (navigating, clicking, typing etc.).  Implementors of the WebDriver API are called <em>drivers</em> which perform all requested operations in a more or less specific way. Following this concept, the only difference between testing on web browsers like <em>Internet Explorer</em> and <em>Mozilla Firefox</em> is the usage of a different driver, because the whole test code uses the common WebDriver API.</p><h5 id="Example">Example</h5><p>This example demonstrates the usage of the WebDriver API for a very common situation: the submission of a form. This form is embedded in an HTML page which obviously has to be loaded before we can go ahead.</p><p>For this example we assume that the form to be submitted has the ID <em>sampleForm</em> and the input elements, whose values should be submitted, have the name <em>name</em>.</p><p>First of all, we have to obtain the XLT driver instance. This is done by calling the method <code>getDriver()</code>, that is defined in the test super class <code>com.xceptanxe.xlt.api.tests.AbstractTestCase</code>. After that, we can use the instance method <code>get(String)</code> of the XLT driver to load the desired page.</p><p>The resulting page contains the HTML form we are looking for. So we try to get the form by instructing the driver to locate it for us by calling the instance method <code>findHtmlElement(By)</code>. This method expects an argument of the type <code>By</code>, which represents the searching strategy to be used. The appropriate class <code>By</code> provides various static methods to construct a searching strategy. We will use <code>By.id(String)</code>.  </p><p>Having obtained the form, we can use it to identify the enclosed input elements by using the methods: <code>findHtmlElements</code> or <code>findHtmlElement</code>. We will use the first one, because we are looking for more than one element. But this time the searching strategy has changed. We have to identify the elements by name instead of by ID. As the result of the call, we get a list of elements. This list should contain exactly two elements. This will be validated using the <code>assertEquals</code> method of the JUnit class <code>org.junit.Assert</code>. </p><p>Now we have to set the new values of the input elements. The WebDriver API offers a convenient method to do this: the method <code>sendKeys</code> simulates the typing on a keyboard. This method is available for all HTML elements that accept keyboard input.</p><p>Once the new values have been set, we are ready to submit the form. This can be achieved in two ways: Either we localize an input element that triggers the form submission or we just use the instance method <code>submit</code> of the found form that does the magic for us. To avoid to much typing, we pick the second option. </p><blockquote class="warning"><p>Depending on the HTML page logic, it might be necessary to click on a specific button to trigger the correct flow of actions. A lot of elements have <code>onclick</code> methods to add JavaScript to the form processing. Additionally server frameworks make assumption about the flow by evaluating the button value.</p></blockquote><p>The resulting code looks like this: </p><pre class="java"><code>package com.xceptance.xlt.samples.test;

</code></pre><h4 id="Rubyasscriptinglanguagefortestcases441">Ruby as scripting language for test cases (#441)</h4><p>Dynamic languages like <a href="http://www.ruby-lang.org">Ruby</a> are becoming more and more popular. As a consequence, the demand has increased to use a dynamic language as the scripting language for developing and running load and regression tests. Because scripting languages pair greatly with rapid prototyping approaches, XLT supports Ruby as a scripting language now. Ruby scripts can be used like any other Java test case. The ruby integration supports both API flavors &#8211; the action concept and the WebDriver API.</p><blockquote class="information"><p><a href="http://www.jruby.org/">JRuby</a> is a 100% pure-Java implementation of the ruby programming language which enables the execution of Ruby code inside Java code and vice versa. The Ruby code benefits from JIT-compilation and optimization, high performance, real threading and a gigantic amount of Java libraries. For more detailed information about JRuby and its use see the <a href="http://www.jruby.org/">official home page</a>. </p></blockquote><p>XLT ships JRuby 1.3.1 as a single Java archive which can be found in the XLT library directory. The appropriate licenses are located at the 3rd party license directory. JRuby is licensed under the three-license model CPL/LPGL/GPL.</p><h5 id="JRubyTestScripts">JRuby Test Scripts</h5><p>Tests for XLT are created by sub-classing the abstract Java class <em>com.xceptance.xlt.api.tests.AbstractTestCase</em>. This is identical to writing a plain Java test case. Furthermore, your test scripts must contain exactly one class which declares exactly one method the name of which starts with <em>test</em> to satisfy the JUnit part of the testing.</p><p>The name of your test script must be the same as the name of the class it is declaring followed by the Ruby script extension <em>.rb</em>. For example, if you declare a JRuby test class named <em>Regression</em> then your script must be named <em>Regression.rb</em>. The location where you store your JRuby test scripts is important because it is identified using the naming scheme of Java packages. This way, all of your test scripts &#8211; Java or JRuby &#8211; use the same organizational structure and are configured in the same way.</p><p>When you design your test scripts you can choose between two concepts: action-based or WebDriver-based tests. As for the language, it doesn&#8217;t matter if you are writing your test scripts in Java or in Ruby because the general procedure is the same in either case: Actions have to subclass the appropriate abstract Java class and implement the methods <em>preValidate</em>, <em>postValidate</em> and <em>execute</em> whereas WebDriver-based tests simply use the provided API as described above. </p><p>To demonstrate the usage of JRuby as scripting language for XLT you may want to have a look at the sample test suite which contains a number of ruby tests in the <em>rubysamples</em> part.</p><h5 id="JRubyTestRunner">JRuby Test Runner</h5><p>When you develop the test scripts it is often useful to run them out of the box just to check for proper functioning. Therefore we provide a UNIX shell script named <em>jruby.sh</em> and a Windows batch file named <em>jruby.cmd</em> which enable command line execution of one or more Ruby tests. Both scripts are located in the binary directory of your XLT installation (<code>&lt;xlt&gt;/bin</code>).</p><p>The Ruby test runner scripts use the format <code>jruby [-I&lt;path&gt;|&lt;test&gt;]+</code> where <code>&lt;test&gt;</code> refers to a JRuby test &#8211; using the same naming scheme as mentioned above &#8211; and where <code>&lt;path&gt;</code> refers to a directory that should be added to the JRuby load path. The first example command line starts the <em>TVisitor</em> test, while the second example executes two tests one after the another. First the action-based Ruby version of TVisitor, after that the WebDriver version of it. You have to run the test cases from the main directory of your test suite by referring to the jruby start script of your XLT installation.</p><pre class="plain"><code>../../bin/jruby.sh com.xceptance.xlt.samples.tests.jruby.TVisitor

So, please make sure, that the property file <code>&lt;xlt&gt;/config/mastercontroller.properties</code> is up-to-date and the property value of the key <code>com.xceptance.xlt.mastercontroller.agentfiles</code> points to the directory containing your test classes and configuration.</p></blockquote><blockquote class="warning"><p>In contrast to the normal test execution via Eclipse or another IDE, where the test results are placed in the <code>results</code> directory of the test suite, an execution via the JRuby test runner will place the results in the <code>results</code> directory of the XLT installation you are using.</p></blockquote><h5 id="Example2">Example</h5><p>Let&#8217;s use the previous example from the WebDriver section again, which opens a page, fills in the embedded form, and submits it afterwards. </p><p>Remember, the Ruby test script must be named exactly as the declared class followed by the Ruby extension <em>.rb</em>. Having this in mind, we create a new file named <em>FormSubmit.rb</em> in a sub directory of <em>src/com/xceptance/xlt/samples/tests</em> of the sample test suite.

</code></pre><blockquote class="warning"><p>This property changes the behavior of the <code>loadPageXYZ</code> method when it is not passed an explicitly specified timeout value. Previously when no waiting time was specified, no waiting was performed at all. Now, the specified default timeout will be obeyed. To load a page without any timeout, 0 has to be specified as the timeout value explicitly when the method is called.</p></blockquote><h4 id="Supportforproxyauthentication59">Support for proxy authentication (#59)</h4><p>XLT is able to route traffic through an HTTP proxy. If the proxy requires user authentication, the credentials needed can now be configured as additional properties in the file <code>default.properties</code>:</p><pre class="plain"><code>com.xceptance.xlt.proxy.userName = myUserName
com.xceptance.xlt.proxy.password = myPassword
</code></pre><h4 id="HtmlUnitupdatedtov2.5360">HtmlUnit updated to v2.5 (#360)</h4><p>XLT now uses the latest stable version of HtmlUnit &#8211; 2.5 &#8211; with many important improvements and fixes. See the <a href="http://htmlunit.sourceforge.net/">HtmlUnit web site</a> for a complete list of enhancements. XLT includes additional bug fixes from coming HtmlUnit versions, as well as load test specific modifications.</p><p class="warning">Please refrain from updating HtmlUnit yourself to avoid incompatibilities and defects. </p><h4 id="Destinationdirectorycommandlineswitch533">Destination directory command line switch (#533)</h4><p>All command lines for the creation of reports have been enhanced to use the same command line switch <code>-o</code>. This switch is used to specify an alternate output directory when creating reports. Please note, that this is the target directory and is created if it does not exist. No additional sub directory for the report is created automatically.</p><h3 id="BugFixes4">Bug Fixes</h3><p class="abstract">This sections covers all important defects that have been fixed with this release.</p><h4 id="Incorrectactionsrecordedwhenmultiplebrowserareopen430">Incorrect actions recorded when multiple browser are open (#430)</h4><p>The recorder incorrectly recorded some actions when multiple windows or browser tabs were opened in Firefox. This has been fixed and the recorder obeys the context now. It will stop recording when another tab is set active.</p><h4 id="Autocompletedforminformationnotcaptured434">Auto-completed form information not captured (#434)</h4><p>Previous version of the XLT recorder did not capture values of auto-completed form fields correctly.</p><h2 id="XLT3.2.X">XLT 3.2.X</h2><p class="abstract">You can find a  set of previous release notes for XLT 3.2.X by following this link: <a href="releasenotes-3.2.html">Release Notes XLT 3.2</a> </p><p id="copyright">Copyright &#169; 2014 by <a href="http://www.xceptance.com/">Xceptance Software Technologies</a>.
