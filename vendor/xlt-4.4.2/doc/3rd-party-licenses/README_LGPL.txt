This software is distributed together with some libraries (cssparser, jcommon, jfreechart, jna, platform) which are licensed under the terms of the LGPL version 2.1 or later.

As already stated by the license files, this license remains valid for them. Addidtionally we have to give installations instructions about how to use Xceptance Load Test with new or modified versions of these libraries to comply to section 6a of LGPL 2.1 and section 4e of LGPL version 3.

If you want to exchange a library just delete the old version from and copy the new one into the directory /lib of the Xceptance Load Test distribution (whereas "/" denotes the root directory of the exploded zip file). If doing so take care that the interfaces of the new / modified version of the library comply to the ones of the removed libraries. You are not causing any legal issues by not doing so but Xceptance Load Test may stop working.
