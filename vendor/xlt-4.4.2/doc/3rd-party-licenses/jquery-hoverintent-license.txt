hoverIntent is similar to jQuery's built-in "hover" function except that
instead of firing the onMouseOver event immediately, hoverIntent checks
to see if the user's mouse has slowed down (beneath the sensitivity
threshold) before firing the onMouseOver event.

hoverIntent is currently available for use in all personal or commercial 
projects under both MIT and GPL licenses. This means that you can choose 
the license that best suits your project, and use it accordingly.
