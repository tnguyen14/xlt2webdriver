In most cases there is one license file for each distributed jar. However there are a few exceptions to avoid some duplicate license files for jars from the same project.

The license is the same for all components of Selenium. Thus the license file "selenium-license" is the valid license for
selenium-android-driver, selenium-api, selenium-chrome-driver, selenium-firefox-driver, selenium-htmlunit-driver,
selenium-ie-driver, selenium-iphone-driver, selenium-java, selenium-remote-driver and selenium-support.

The serializer.jar comes from the Xalan project, thus you find the license conditions for this library and the xalan-${version}.jar in the file named "xalan-license.txt".

Because of the license for jquery and xml-apis requiring several files, there are correspondingly named directories containing all these license files for these libraries.

xmlpull and xpp3_min are public domain and thus have no license file.
